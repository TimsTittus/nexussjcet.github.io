The **Swathanthra Group** was inaugurated on **9th September, 2010**, by none other than **Richard M. Stallman**, the father of the Free Software Movement. His visit to St. Joseph’s College of Engineering & Technology (SJCET), Palai, marked a significant milestone in promoting Free Software ideals among students and the public. 

Richard Stallman delivered an inspiring talk on *“Free Software and Your Freedom”*, shedding light on the threats posed by proprietary software and advocating for the freedom to control one's own computing activities. 

### Objectives of Swathanthra:
- Advocate and promote the use of Free Software.
- Organize seminars, workshops, and campaigns to raise awareness.
- Provide a platform for developing and sharing Free Software resources.

This event laid the foundation for fostering a culture of freedom and collaboration at SJCET.

The **Nexus Project**, established by **Abraham Raji** on **11th November, 2018**, was dedicated to software and hardware freedom. It provided a platform for students to engage in FOSS-related initiatives and collaborate on innovative projects.

### Restructuring and Evolution
In **2022**, under the leadership of **Rajat Mathew**, The Nexus was restructured as the **FOSS Club of SJCET**, uniting three generations of open-source initiatives:
1. **Swathanthra Group (2010)**  
2. **ICFOSS Cell (2018)**  
3. **Mozilla Campus Club (2013)**  

This restructuring created a cohesive and vibrant community, now known as **The Nexus Project**, functioning as part of the **FOSSUnited Foundation**. The Nexus continues to uphold its mission of advocating for software and hardware freedom while fostering innovation and collaboration.
