### The Formation of The Nexus | 2018

The **Nexus** was founded on **12th September, 2018**, by a group of free thinkers at SJCET to support and organize activities related to Free/Libre and Open-Source Software and Hardware. Its mission included:
- Advocating for freedoms of speech, press, and association on the internet.
- Supporting the rights to use, study, modify, and redistribute both software and hardware designs.
- Promoting unimpeded software and hardware engineering.

### The Nexus Project | 2018

The **Nexus Project**, established by **Abraham Raji** on **11th November, 2018**, was dedicated to software and hardware freedom. It provided a platform for students to engage in FOSS-related initiatives and collaborate on innovative projects.

### Restructuring and Evolution
In **2022**, under the leadership of **Rajat Mathew**, The Nexus was restructured as the **FOSS Club of SJCET**, uniting three generations of open-source initiatives:
1. **Swathanthra Group (2010)**  
2. **ICFOSS Cell (2018)**  
3. **Mozilla Campus Club (2013)**  

This restructuring established a unified community, now known as **The Nexus Project** . 

The community flourished over the years thanks to the efforts of dedicated students and faculty. Its integration with **FOSSUnited** in 2024 marks the start of an exciting new chapter, amplifying its reach and impact in the global open-source community. This partnership offers crucial support and funding, enabling us to host meaningful FOSS events and advance our mission of promoting software and hardware freedom while fostering innovation and collaboration.
